# PPIJ: Magiƒçni Kvadrati (Magic Squares)

A HTML5 canvas game that was embedded in a group project for the 3rd year college subject Programske paradigme i jezici - PPIJ (Programming paradigms and languages).

The project was select to be one of the few to be presented in front of company recruiters.
It earned the maximum grade and allowed all group members to skip the final exam.

The goal of the game is to have the same sum of numbers in each row, column and diagonal using unique numbers.
Difficulty can be adjusted by changing the settings.

Every element of the game is drawn and animated programatically without extenal libraries or assets other than fonts.
Drawn elements use a hierarchical layout.
Colors are chosen in such a way that all background, interactable and hovered-over elements use distinct and consistent colors.
This enables the user to intuitively know how to approach what they see.
